## LPDA.txt
The LPDA singular raw neutrino template values used for this study

## correlate.py 
Calculates the correlation values for signal and noise input data sets and then gives the efficiency curve of the data that is similar to the efficiency curves within DL studies

## signal_vs_noise_eff_values.npy
generated from correlate.py script above

## trimmed100_data_signal_LPDA_ch0_0.036sa_10.0vrms_no_noise.npy
Simulated neutrino template that is trimmed to 100 samples around the max values of the max channel
