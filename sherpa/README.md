When running the python script that is using Sherpa, one of the terminal printouts will look something like this:

INFO:sherpa.core:
-------------------------------------------------------
SHERPA Dashboard running. Access via
http://169.234.34.214:8880 or 
http://dhcp-v034-214.mobile.uci.edu:8880 if on a cluster, or 
http://localhost:8880 if running locally.
-------------------------------------------------------

Copy and paste any of these links into a webbrowser and the interactive Sherpa dashboard will pop up and allow the user to check the progress of the various trainings. The web browser can be coninually refreshed to see progress and the dashboard will closer after all trainings are completed.
